            title: "<h1 className='title-font'>Archimandrite Antonin Kapustin</h1>",
            info: `
            Kapustin was a member of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, honorary member of the Imperial Architecture Society, member of the German Society for the Exploration of Palestine and also member of the architecture & antiquities societies of Odessa and Athens.
        
        <h1 className='title-font'>Background</h1>
        Kapustin was born on the August 12th in 1817 in the village of Baturino in the province of Perm in the Ural mountain range, Russia to a priestly family. His father served as the priest of the same village. He studied at the Kiev Theological Academy and by the end of his studies he was already a professor at the same academy where he taught German and Greek. In 1850 he is sent on his first assignment to the church of Nicodemus the Savior in Athens, Greece that was purchased by the Russian government of Tsar Nikolai II.
This was the position at which he began to get involved in archaeology in the first place. His archaeological endeavors will accompany him during his quests of the Holy Land in the Middle East and will gradually constitute an important part of his identity. As a participant in archaeological excavations in Greece, he unearthed remnants of an earlier church and a Roman bath that greatly ignited his interest. In 1860 Kapustin was appointed priest of the Russian embassy church in Constantinople where he got acquainted with very influential personalities that will prove very valuable in the upcoming parts of his quests.
In 1865 Kapustin becomes the head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and also the chief of the third religious delegation in Jerusalem. This position will only prove significant for Kapustin himself, but also for Jerusalem, the Russian Church and Russia as a whole. His intention was to reinforce the Russian orthodox presence in the Holy Land against the rest of the orthodox currents but first and foremost to provide accommodation and shelter for Russian pilgrims to the Holy Land.
“At his isolated post he did not sit cross-handed; he dovoted all of his day and most of the night working tirelessly and intensively. His chamber doors were not closed since the early morning hours until late at night; during the morning hours he was accepting the local people – granted solutions to their disputes, consulted them wisely and offered considerable help with basic needs and their financing.
The day would go on with admittance of the teachers from the schools that he and the other mission members founded and Russian pilgrims freely and confidently flowing to his chambers: respectful figures, merchants and peasants, rich and poor would approach him to find solutions to troublesome and perplexed issues that occupied them. Fr. Antonin would speak for long hours and with great enthusiasm.
Kapustin managed to attract large numbers of pilgrims and generally people surrounding him to be part of his ventures to which he was dedicated wholeheartedly”. (Prof. Alexey Afanasevich Dmitrievsky, the famous historian-liturgist, professor of the Kiev Theological Academy – 1856-1929)
Contra the intensification of Western presence in the Holy Land, Russia had to respond aggressively and reinforce its presence in Palestine. Archim. Kapustin does not waste any time and begins purchasing land with proximity to holy sites that are ample in the ancient land of Israel. In the same period foreign nationals were not allowed to buy land properties in Palestine, therefore Kapustin gets associated with a dragoman (guide, translator and mediator especially in Arab-speaking territories), an Ottoman citizen named Yakov Yegorovich Aleppo; he acts as a useful agent and practically he is the one performing the purchases for the Russian Church and the IOPS.
Kapustin’s life was long and full of suffering, especially in his twilight days, because of a disease that frequently caused him unbearable pain and reminded him that death is inevitable. Despite all that, he remained active with the same zeal; be it the field of science or the pilgrimage undertakings, the schools or the churches. It can definitely be said that Fr. Antonin was active and operational almost until his last hours and that he consistently fixed himself the highest of standards. “My health is like a rock (on my heart)”, he used to say. “I find it difficult to engage in science now. In the past I could work for seven-eight consecutive hours and now three-four, not more, my eyes are fatigued...”.
In March 24th 1894, at the age of 77, the bells sounded and Jerusalem was mourning Archim. Kapustin’s passing. The following day a memorial service (panichida) was carried out in his honor in the Holy Trinity cathedral by Patriarch Gerasimus himself. The funeral procession that began from the church quickly turned into a royal procession, which was extraordinary even for the city of Jerusalem which had experienced big ceremonies in the past. By nightfall, the procession reached the Galilee, where Metropolite Epipahnios of Jordan joined it. Fr. Antonin Kapustin was buried in the Russian church of Ascension in the Mount of Olives.
40 years after his death, in 1934, Fr. Kapustin’s diary was published.

In 2012 the Russian Patriarch Cyril paid a visit to Kapustin’s tomb in the church of Ascension, where he eulogized him more than a hundred years after his passing.


“It is not without Divine Providence that Father Antonin passed away here and was buried here. Associated with his name are the most important pages in the history of Russian pilgrimage and Russian presence in the Holy Land. Today is the time when thousands of pilgrims from all over Holy Russia can again come to this place to find here consolation and loving reception”.`

            Archim. Antonin Kapustin constitutes an inseparable part of the foundation of IOPS – his connections to key personalities in Palestine and Russian nobility contributed to the realization of the vision. Furthermore, the Society’s representatives that arrived from Russia to the land of Israel for the first time would go out on excursions on horses escorted by Kapustin and through them they would learn to accommodate to and recognize the region and also grasp the sanctity of the place.

            The Russian Orthodox Church cherishes him with the following words: “It is precisely him, the lonely righteous that his contemporaries did not know to appreciate, we owe our gratitude for the unique historical legacy; what we call today Russian Palestine is mainly the outcome of Russian activity in the Holy Land during a half century.
            
            In 1879 Kapustin describes in his memoirs the principal motivation to his conduct: “I have left all my life aspirations behind and devoted my entire existence to the reinforcement and the glorification of Russia’s name in the Holy Land, so that we are not guests there anymore but equally rightful owners.
            
            Kapustin was involved in the purchase, erection and renovation of a multitude of sites all over the Holy Land: the Mount of Oives, Ein Karem, Bayt Jala, Hebron, Jaffa, Tiberias and Nazareth. These are the principal and most known land properties he purchased in Palestine: 
            
            Oak of Mamre (Oak of Abraham)
            He buys the territory on which the “Oak of Abraham” is located adjacent to Hebron, the place in which it is believed that Abraham hosted the three angels that announced him the news of Sarah, his barren wife, giving birth to his son. A church was erected on the site devoted to the Holy Trinity whose facade reminds the one of the famous church in Jerusalem.
            
            Chapel of the Ascension
            Kapustin acquires an extensive territory on the Mount of Olives on which is located the Chapel of the Ascension and the popular bell tower next to it. The remarkable bell arrives via the sea from Russia and Kapustin openly calls for volunteers to carry the bell to the church and eventually a hundred people escort the bell with prayers and songs.
            
            The Chapel of the Ascension gains astonishing respect and Binyamin Zeev Hertzl visits there alongside the German Kaiser Wilhelm II.
            
            Hertzl writes in his diary: “We got up the Russian tower, I reached until the first balcony as dizziness overwhelmed me. The rest of the gentlemen made it to the top. A view beyond any comparison overlooking the Jordan valley with its mountainsides, the Dead Sea, the Moab mountains, the eternal city of Jerusalem. Spare time and a carefree mind are required in order to process all these impressions.”
            
            Moreover, in 1869 Kapustin builds a shelter for pilgrims together with a neo-Byzantine style church in Jaffa, inaugurates a residence for pilgrims in Tiberias and bought a relatively big field of land by the village of Bayt Jala, where he constructed his personal residence. In 1886 this site was presented by Kapustin to the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovic.
            
            In 1873 Kapustin obtains an additional field adjacent to Bayt Jala, upon which a big educational center was built and in 1874 he purchased another piece of land in Jericho, where a shelter was built for pilgrims passing from Jericho to Jordan. This house was the only European building in the area and around it Muslim Arab neighbors that lived nearby.
            
            In 1885 the Orthodox Society for Palestine, aided by Kapustin, launched five schools for girls and boys in Nazareth, Beirut and Damascus.

            Archaeology
            The most important archaeological excavation Kapustin performed occurred at the A. Nevsky site in the old city of Jerusalem. Originally the A. Nevsky site was planned to host the first Russian consulate in the land of Israel in 1857. While laying the initial foundations for the erection of the consulate, archaeological findings emerged that bore paramount importance for both the christian world and the history of the city of Jerusalem. 
            
            During the joint excavations of Kapustin and the well-known archaeologist Conrad Schick, a gate of the old city’s wall was discovered dating back to the Roman period. According to christian faith, the gate is the “Gate of Judgment” through which Jesus exited Jerusalem to the route that led to the hill of Golgotha (Calvary). The new fascinating finding caused the Russians to abandon the idea of the consulate and instead construct a church. The Gate of Judgment is still exhibited surrounded by glass and icons donated by the Tsar.
            
            In fact, the Gate of Judgment constitutes proof about the veracity of the Christian writings and as a result it instigated Russia’s efforts in archaeological excavations in the land of Israel.
            An additional equally significant finding is an ancient sarcophagus whose story is still vague until today.
            Other findings were exhibited and were kept secure for long years until WWI by which time the majority had been destroyed, disappeared or stolen.
            
            Kapustin carried out archaeological excavations on the Mount of Olives, in Jericho and in the Silwan neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Furthermore, he excavated in land plots purchased by the Russian Empire in Jaffa, Ein Karem and the Russian Compound among others. The most precious finding Kapustin unearthed was a bust of Herod the Great, which he donated to the national museum of Russia, the Hermitage, and left a copy for himself.
            
            Kapustin gathered a big number of his findings in Grony monastery, a Russian womens’ monastery on the site of Moskoviya in Ein Karem, in a systematic manner in one of the halls. Artifacts from ancient Egypt and from the Second Temple period, gravestones from the Jewish cemetery in Jaffa, Hellenistic, Roman and Christian scripts and relics were all put in the same basket.
            
            In 1929 researcher Elizabeth Lukianoff together with her husband spent four months in Gorny monastery, but even this timeframe was not enough to complete the task of arranging all of the artifacts. Kapustin bequeathed the museum to the Russian religious mission and the access to it is limited.
            Apart from his archaeological activity in the land of Israel, Kapustin also stayed in Saint Catherine’s monastery for two months. There he documented and cataloged the Greek library found in the monastery. Kapustin translated the Codex Sinaiticus, which was relocated and exhibited in the Hermitage in Russia.            
          
            Astronomy
          
            Triggered by his fondness of astronomy and the stars, Kapustin built several towers (such as Hebron, Ein Karem) in order to be able to fulfill his passion for the observation of celestial bodies. In his scarce free time Archimandrite Kapustin would stroll to the tower he built in Ein Karem, observe the stars and write his impressions in his numerous journals.

            info: `
            The Cairo Genizah is a huge collection of Jewish manuscripts and books that were composed between the 9th and the 19th century CE and were preserved in the attic of one of the oldest synagogues in existence in the world today, the Ben Ezra synagogue in Cairo. Jewish religious law does not permit destroying or casting away scripts written in Hebrew. When they are worn out and out of use, the manuscripts and texts are stored in distinctive storerooms (genizot – pl. genizah), oftentimes in designated tombs for this purpose in cemeteries or on the rooftops of synagogues, much like the case of the Cairo Genizah. The people working in the above mentioned Cairo synagogue did not only conserve sacred texts but also legal documents, court proceedings, financial documents, bills, communal name lists, parts of notes and correspondence; all this out of respect and reverence for each and every word written in Hebrew letters. The specifically dry Egyptian climate was instrumental for the conservation of the scripts and as a consequence an impressive archive was preserved, which documented the Jewry of the Mediterranean.
            At the point that the trade of the fascinating scripts found in the attic of the synagogue in Cairo began to accelerate in the 19th century Kapustin purchased parts of the Cairo Genizah supported by donations.
            Thanks to his unsurpassed connections in Jerusalem and his acquaintances of the merchants, Kapustin gained access to selected and unique pieces of the Genizah.
            Posthumously and according to his will, all of these materials are exhibited in a special collection bearing Kapustin’s name in the central library in Saint-Peterburg.
            Kapustin’s collection includes 1,200 unique scripts. This collection was used to study Judaism, oriental customs, the Hebrew language and was even used to determine and clarify Jewish religious rules from rabbis based on content from the Genizah. Kapustin’s compilation of scripts includes Hebrew and Arabic literature from the Geonim era in Egypt and all of the Middle East, biblical literature, all of the talmudic tractates (massechtot), various manuscripts and almost the entirety of the “Chapters of the Fathers” (Pirkei Avot) along with philosophical, historic and medical scripts. As a matter of fact, Kapustin’s Cairo collection proved useful to almost every branch in Judaism studies and research and it could be said that it is one of the most thorough and quality compilations of the Cairo Genizah, which Kapustin preserved and made accessible to the broad public.
